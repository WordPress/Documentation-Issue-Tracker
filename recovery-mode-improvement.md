# Recovery Mode Email Clarification

When WordPress encounters a fatal error, it sends a Recovery Mode email to the site administrator.  
This email includes a special login link that allows access to the site's dashboard in Recovery Mode.

**Important Points:**
- Recovery Mode links are valid for 24 hours.
- The email is sent to the admin email address configured in WordPress Settings.
- If the email is not received, users should check spam folders or contact their hosting provider.
- Recovery Mode allows administrators to deactivate problematic plugins or themes.
